Step 4: Update vite.config.js file
Vite is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Open vite.config.js and copy-paste the following code. First invoice defineConfig from vite at the top of the file and also import laravel-vite-plugin. Here plugins() take the path of the js and CSS file and create bundles for your application. you need to add vue() in the plugins array.

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'


export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        vue(),
        laravel([
            'resources/css/app.css',
            'resources/js/app.js',
        ]),
    ],
});
```
Step 4: Vite Dev Server Start
Now after installing the vue 3, we need to start the dev server for vite for that run the following command and it will watch your resources/js/app.js file and resources/css/app.css file. It also starts a vite server on http://localhost:3000. you can not open it in the browser as it is for vite hot reload and it runs in the background and watches the assets of your application like js and CSS.
```command
npm run dev
```
Step 5: Create Vue 3 App
In resources/js/app.js create an instance of the vue 3 firstly you import { createApp } from 'vue' and createApp It takes a parameter here we have passed App. Before that, you can create a vue file which is the main file responsible for the vuejs content name is App.vue.
```js
// app.js
require('./bootstrap');

import {createApp} from 'vue'

import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App).mount("#app")
```

```js
<template>
    How To Install Vue 3 in Laravel 9 with Vite - TechvBlogs
